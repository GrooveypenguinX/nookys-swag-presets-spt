How can I use the patterns in the "extra-patterns" folder?

just copy and paste them into your SWAG/config/patterns folder, that's it.

HOWEVER...keep in mind that patterns get combined, so if you have multiple Labs patterns (i.e "labs_all_boss_waves.json" and "labs_pmc.json") all spawns in these files will be combined. So if you ONLY want bosses in labs you would have to delete the other Labs files.
